FCTelnet
--------

This is a IIgs telnet client I wrote circa 2004.  I recently dusted it
off and fixed a couple telnet negotiation bugs.

It uses 4-color 640x200 graphics, which means it's slower than text but
has twice as many colors!

Characters are 8 pixels wide (80 x 8 = 640) which is a bit heavy on the
character spacing, but the drawing is simpler than 7 pixel characters.
